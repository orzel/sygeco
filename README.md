Small console based on attiny85, compatible with tinyjoypad.

More information available [on the hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/177743-sygeco/)

The `hardware/` directory contains kicad files for the schematics and pcb, as well as some support files for parts and 3d rendering.
The `launcher/` directory provides a PyQt script to easily select and program any game. It's easily customizable, if you want to add/change games or configure the `avrdude` programmer used.

No games is included though. The hackaday page has a zip file with the launcher and most available games, pre-configured.
